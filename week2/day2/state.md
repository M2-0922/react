### State

In ReactJS, state is a JavaScript object that holds data that affects how the component is rendered and behaves.

State can be initialized in a component's constructor method using the this.state object. It can also be updated using the setState() method, which is a built-in React method that allows us to update the state of a component and re-render it.

When state is updated using setState(), React will re-render the component and its children with the updated state values. This allows us to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces in React applications.

It's important to note that state should only be used for data that is specific to a component and not shared across the application. For shared data, React provides a way to manage application-level data using props and context.

In `functional components`, state can be managed using the `useState` hook, which was introduced in React 16.8. The `useState` hook is a function that returns an array with two values: the current state value and a function to update that state value. Here's an example:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Example = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
);
```

In this example, count is the current state value, and setCount is the function to update that state value. When the user clicks the "Click me" button, the setCount function is called with the new count value, and the component is re-rendered with the updated state.

In` class components`, state is managed using the `this.state` object, which is initialized in the constructor method. Here's an example:

```js
import React from 'react';

class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, count is the current state value, which is initialized to 0 in the constructor method. When the user clicks the "Click me" button, the setState method is called with the new count value, and the component is re-rendered with the updated state.

### Updating State

State can be updated using the `setState()` method, which is a built-in React method that allows us to update the state of a component and re-render it.

When state is updated using `setState()`, React will re-render the component and its children with the updated state values. This allows us to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces in React applications.

```js
function addTwoNumbers(a, b) {
    a = 42
    return a + b
}

console.log(addTwoNumbers(1, 2))

function Navbar(props) {
    props.coverImage = "something else"
}

<Navbar darkMode={true} coverImage="some-image2" />
```

```js
const result = React.useState("Yes")
console.log(result) // [ "Yes", function() {} ]

or 

import React, { useState } from "react"
useState("Yes")
```
