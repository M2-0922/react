-   What is React? Can you explain its main features and advantages over other JavaScript frameworks?

```js
React is one of the library of Javascript which is latest things.
React consists of components, and by combining components with different styles and logics, you can reuse each component flexibly and easily.

```

-   What is the Virtual DOM in React? How does it help in optimizing the performance of the application?

```js
The Virtual DOM is a concept in React that allows for efficient updating of the actual DOM, which is the representation of the HTML page that is displayed in the browser.
Updating the actual DOM can be slow and inefficient because it involves a lot of manipulation of the HTML elements in the page. The Virtual DOM minimizes the number of manipulations required by updating only the parts of the DOM that have changed, resulting in faster rendering of changes.

```

-   What is the difference between state and props in React?

```js
State is used to manage internal component state that can change over time, while props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

```

-   What are React Hooks? How do they simplify the process of writing functional components?

```js
React Hooks provide a way to manage state and lifecycle methods in functional components, making it easier to write and reuse code. They simplify the process of writing functional components by reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed and making it easier to reason about component behavior.

```

-   What are the lifecycle methods of a React component? Explain each one.

```js
There are three type of phase in react lifecycle which are mount, update and unmount.
1. Mounting phase:
constructor(): This is the first method called when a component is created. It is used to initialize state, bind methods, and set default props.

render(): This method is required and is called after the constructor() method. It returns a JSX representation of the component and is used to render the component to the DOM.

componentDidMount(): This method is called after the component has been rendered to the DOM. It is used to perform actions that require the component to be present in the DOM, such as setting up event listeners or fetching data from an API.

2. Updating phase:
shouldComponentUpdate(): This method is called before the component is updated. It is used to optimize performance by determining if the component should be re-rendered. If this method returns false, the component will not be updated.

componentDidUpdate(): This method is called after the component has been updated. It is used to perform actions that require the component to be present in the DOM, such as updating the state or fetching new data from an API.

3. Unmounting phase:
componentWillUnmount(): This method is called just before the component is removed from the DOM. It is used to clean up any resources that were set up in the componentDidMount() method, such as removing event listeners or cancelling API requests.



```

-   How does React handle errors and exceptions in the application?

```js
Errors and exceptions can be handled using the ErrorBoundary component. An ErrorBoundary is a higher-order component that wraps other components and catches any errors that are thrown during their rendering or lifecycle methods.

```

-   What is JSX in React? How does it differ from HTML and what are the benefits of using it?

```js
JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files. It is a syntax sugar that makes it easier to write and read the code that renders React components.

```

-   What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React? When would you use each one?

```js
Controlled components are React components that manage the state of a form element in their own state and provide full control over the form element's state, while uncontrolled components rely on the browser DOM to manage the state of the form element and are typically used when managing the state of a form element outside of React.

```

-   What is Redux? How does it integrate with React? What are its core principles?

```js
Redux is a state management library that provides a predictable and centralized way to manage the state of an application. It integrates with React through the use of the React-Redux library, and its core principles include a single source of truth, read-only state, changes made with pure functions, and changes made through composition.

```

-   What are some best practices for writing efficient and maintainable React code?

```js
Keep components small and focused:
Large components can be difficult to read and maintain. It's best to break them down into smaller, more focused components that are easier to understand and reuse.

```
