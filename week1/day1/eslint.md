`ESLint` is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in JavaScript code. It is used to enforce coding standards, best practices, and to catch common errors in code. `ESLint` can be used to detect issues with code formatting, variable naming, code complexity, and more.

`ESLint` works by analyzing JavaScript code and reporting any issues that it finds. It can be integrated into a development environment, such as an editor or build system, to provide real-time feedback on code quality. `ESLint` can also be run as a standalone tool, allowing developers to check their code for issues before committing it to a code repository.

`ESLint` is highly configurable and supports a wide range of plugins and configurations. This allows it to be customized to fit the specific needs of a project or organization. Some popular configurations for `ESLint` include the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, Google JavaScript Style Guide, and StandardJS.

In summary, `ESLint` is a tool for enforcing code quality and best practices in JavaScript code. It is widely used in modern JavaScript development and can be integrated into development environments to provide real-time feedback on code quality.
