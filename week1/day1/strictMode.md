`React.StrictMode` is a feature in React that helps developers write better React code by highlighting potential problems and warnings during development. It is not intended for use in production code and should only be used during development.

When you wrap your React application or a part of it in a React.StrictMode component, React performs additional checks and warnings to help you identify potential issues in your code. These checks include:

Identifying unsafe lifecycle methods and deprecated APIs
Detecting state changes during rendering
Warning about the use of legacy string ref APIs
Identifying potential issues with concurrent mode
By using React.StrictMode, developers can catch and fix potential issues early on in the development process. It helps improve the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.

Here's an example of how to use React.StrictMode:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

In this example, the App component is wrapped in React.StrictMode. This will enable additional checks and warnings during development to help you write better code.
