`The Virtual DOM` is a key concept in ReactJS that helps to improve the performance of user interfaces by reducing the number of times the actual DOM is updated.

Here's how it works:

- When a React component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree that represents the updated UI.
- React then compares the new Virtual DOM tree to the previous Virtual DOM tree to identify the minimum number of changes needed to update the actual DOM.
- React then updates the actual DOM with the minimum number of changes necessary to reflect the updated UI.

This process is called "reconciliation" and it allows React to update the UI more efficiently, since it only updates the parts of the DOM that have actually changed.

Let's look at an example to see how this works in practice:

Suppose we have a React component that displays a list of items:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ItemList() {
  const [item, setItem] = useState(0);
  
  const addItem = () => {
    const newItem = `item${items.length + 1}`;
    setItem(...)
  }
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={...}>Add Item</button>
      <ul>
        {items.map(item => <li key={...}>{item}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we're using the useState hook to manage the state of our list of items. When the user clicks the "Add Item" button, we update the state by adding a new item to the list.

Without the Virtual DOM, every time we update the list of items, React would need to update the entire <ul> element in the actual DOM. This can be slow and inefficient, especially for large lists.

However, with the Virtual DOM, React is able to identify the specific <li> element that needs to be added or removed, and only update that portion of the DOM. This makes the UI updates much faster and more efficient.

Overall, the Virtual DOM is a powerful and essential feature of ReactJS that helps to improve the performance of user interfaces. By minimizing the number of updates to the actual DOM, React is able to create fast and responsive UIs that can handle complex interactions and data.
